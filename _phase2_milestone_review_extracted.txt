Sign in/Log in Page 
- The design of the page looks great. I’m very happy with it. 
- Australian English (UK) doesn’t use z in organisation, in most cases we use “s” . Can 
that be changed.  
- Cenaris Logo needs to feature in the welcome banner. 
- Cenaris logo needs to be larger on the top banner (the one in the top left) 
- Change the button from “get started” to “Sign up” 
 
Create Account 
- Remove the z in organisation.  
- If I fill in the data fields, then click “toggle theme” (black/white) – I lose the data in 
the fields. Can this be changed so that you don’t lose the data.  
- Continue with Microsoft doesn’t work says “not configured yet” 
- can we have the mobile number and work phone as a compulsory field.  For “work 
phone” we can have a tick box “same as mobile” 
Organisation Setup 
- Have the following options for “organisation type” 
o Sole Trader 
o Company 
o Not-for-Profit 
o Partnership 
o Trust 
o Government / Public Sector 
- Payment window we  need to link in with stripe. (We will need to plan how that will 
work!) 
- Separate “ABN/ACN”. ABN compulsory, ACN optional    
 
 
Dashboard/Homepage 
- Change the tiles to provide an overview of  
o Overall readiness (Combined readiness of subscribed frameworks) 
o Active Deadlines  
o Uploaded Documents (total uploaded) 
o Below is an example of something that’d work well!

- Remove Upload Documents 
o Replace with “compliance readiness” 
o Have each subscribed Framework and it’s current compliance percentage. 
 
- Keep “recent documents” 
- Include/insert “upcoming deadlines” 
o Maybe divide the page into thirds “Compliance Readiness” , “Recent 
Documents” and “upcoming deadlines” 
-  
Evidence Repository 
- Drag and drop function doesn’t work – fix so users can drag and drop 
- Add another option “Photos” 
- Remove “100% secure”  
- Can we include a search function? And a filter option for each subscribed 
framework? 
- Can we view documents within the app? Keeps users in the app without having to 
download

- Future state: we can generate an AI summary of the document. Compliance 
confidence (%) and which standard(s) it is relevant for.  
- Clicking “upload new” and “Upload your first document” takes me back to the 
homepage – can we have it directly prompt the file upload?  
- The formatting is not allowing me to see all the options when I click “actions” . I have 
to scroll down to view them. Can we fix that we don’t have to scroll.  
 
AI Evidence 
- Change AI Evidence to “Upload Evidence” 
- Can we include a safeguard where the individual confirms/rejects the document’s 
alignment to the framework competcy/section? 
- It would be cool to have a future version where we can connect to the user’s 
cloud/file storage and automatically detect and organise their documents for audit.  
- Analyse has no z  
- Change “AI Analysed” to “Documents Analysed” 
- The buttons to upload documents either don’t work, or redirect me to the 
Dashboard. 
Compliance Gap Analysis (FEEDBACK FROM 
MVP) 
- Love it! 
Audit Export (FEEDBACK FROM MVP) 
- Have a button for Audit Pack Report 
- Need options for various functions 
o Deadline report 
o Expired documents 
o Framework changes (new feature we haven’t discussed) 
o Document lists by framework etc.  
- It’d be good to have an ability to “share report” and that can email or invite another 
user to review.  
My profile 
- Should we have a secondary email address (for account security) 
- Can we collect Phone number (mobile) as a compulsory field and allow it to be 
changed here. (if numbers changes)

Team management 
- I cant assign myself to a department.  
Organisation Profile 
- Nowhere to change billing details 
- No contact number  
- ACN needs it’s own box.  
 
Quick add in the corner isn’t working properly with drop downs and the options etc.  
 
We will also need a button to increase/improve subscription – we can talk about this
